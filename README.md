### Structure

The core game logic is written as a Node.js module with the endpoint at `./src/js/game/index.js`, which exposes the necessary objects that should be used on the client side, such as the Game Board, and the Player classes.

As the Javascript code is written in [ES6](https://ponyfoo.com/articles/es6), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) is used to compile them into ES5 Javascript, in either `./lib` for Node.js development, or `./dist` with Gulp for the Web.

These game module contains classes coded such that only key functions are exposed to the user on a high level. For example, we can use these objects to implement a command line version of Tic-Tac-Toe, in `./src/js/game/implementation/`.

Because of this, the game can be set up concisely with callbacks in `./src/js/main.js`, with a simplified version as follows:

```javascript
import gameApi from './src/js/game/index.js';
const game = new gameApi.TicTacToe();
const aiPlayer = new gameApi.players.PerfectPlayer(game, 'AI-Player');
const clientPlayer = new gameApi.playersPlayer(game, 'You');

clientPlayer.onBoardChange(grid => {
    // updateView(grid);
});

clientPlayer.onMyTurn(() => {
    // makeGridClickable();
});

clientPlayer.onGameOver(winnerData => {
    // showWinner(winnerData);
});

game.registerPlayers(aiPlayer, clientPlayer);
game.newGame();
```

React acts as a view for the game which aids in rendering the correct DOM elements depending on it's state.

Finally, all that needs to be done is to Browserify `main.js` with Babel as a plugin, and all the required modules will be compiled for web use. A Gulp task is defined for this, for an automated workflow.

### React

This is my first time using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), and I found it extremely helpful in managing the state of the game in a controlled manner. For example, I want apply a `game-disabled` CSS class to the rendered `<div>` when it is not the client player's turn. Instead of having to set this class directly, React allows me to make the view depend on the component state. A small except would be as follows:

```javascript
class Game extends React.Component {
  newGame = () => {
    // set up game
    // ...

    clientPlayer.onMyTurn(() => {
      this.setState({ myTurn: true });
    });
  }
  // helper function to get the css class
  gridCss = () => {
    if (this.state.myTurn) {
      return 'game-enabled';
    } else {
      return 'game-disabled';
    }
  }
  render() {
    // apply reactive css class
    return <div className={this.gridCss()}>
      // ...
    <div>
  }
}
```

When the callback for `clientPlayer.onMyTurn()` is executed, the `game.state.MyTurn` variable is mutated, which implicitly triggers a new render of the result with a different CSS class attribute.

I highly recommend this [introduction to React](http://reactfordesigners.com/labs/reactjs-introduction-for-people-who-know-just-enough-jquery-to-get-by/).
### Babel

Three plugins are used:

#### `es2015`

To compile the ES6 syntax used

#### `react`

To compile Javascript for React written in JSX

#### `stage-0`

To simplify creation of React classes with ES6 classes.

In ES6:

```javascript
class ExampleButton extends React.component {
  onClick() {
    // do things
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div onClick={this.onClick.bind(this)}>Click Me!</div>
    );
  }
}
```

With ES7 property initializers in `stage-0`, we don't have to explicitly bind our onClick method to `this`.

```javascript
class ExampleButton extends React.component {
  onClick = () => {
    // do things
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div onClick={this.onClick}>Click Me!</div>
    );
  }
}
```

### Web Workers

When I finished implementing the game for the browser, I realized that on the first few turns made, the AI takes a few seconds to process the move that needs to be made. Normally, this would not be a problem, but the synchronous implementation of the Minimax algorithm ended up blocking the entire browser while the move is computed. Thus, I used Web Workers to compute the next move on a separate thread, so that the user experience of the game is preserved.

## Usage

### Installation

#### Dependencies

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org):

You need [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) installed globally to build the webpage.

```bash
# Install Gulp
$ npm install --global gulp
```

#### Building
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ninaadpai/tic-tac-toe.git
$ cd ttt

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Build compiled game to `./dist/index.html`
$ gulp build
```

## Development

### Game Module

We can test the game modules separately from the browser, with these commands below.

The compiled module files are built to `./lib` for development purposes.

#### Building

```bash
# Do this before running any files in `./lib`
$ npm run build
```

#### Other Commands
```bash
# watch and build es6 source files in `./src` to `./lib`
$ npm run watch

# run compiled files, etc.
$ node lib/js/game/implementation/vsAi.js

# Run two player cli game
$ npm run two-player

# Run vs AI cli game
$ npm run vs-ai
```

#### Tests
Tests in `./test` for the game module are written in [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/), and can be executed using the following command.

```bash
$ npm test
```

### Webpage development
The gulpfile has been set up with various tasks to compile and [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) all the Javascript modules into `./dist`, and the final game can be viewed by opening `./dist/index.html` after `gulp build` has been completed.

#### Commands

```bash
# build files to `./dist`
$ gulp build

# Watch files with browserSync
$ gulp watch

# deployment to GitHub Pages
$ gulp deploy
```
